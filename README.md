# A simple restyler including paginator

Forked from: https://github.com/nvictus/pandas-jupyter-paginate by [@nvictus](https://github.com/nvictus),
which was originally forked from: https://gist.github.com/nokados/e8f0a64b55099f2f07a50f2b090c91c7 by [@nokados](https://github.com/nokados)

Now includes:

- The ability to add a tooltip (hover over) to row entries
- The ability to make URLs clickable


Also includes the paginator based on the original work.
